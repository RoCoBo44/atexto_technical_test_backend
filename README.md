## How to run it

You need to have Node.js installed (project version = v13.12.0) and mongo running in the port 27017 (I used docker for this part)
Then run 

### `npm install`

### `npm start`

Open [http://localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001) to view it in the browser

In api/models you can find the schemas for mongoose

In api/routes you can find the api methods with their respective queries to mongodb
